This repo includes coding solutions
to Fibonacci series in Python and word count in Java. 
However, I didn't get enough time to implement occurences of word and print them in descending order in Perl.
Here is the logic:
I would read the file word by word ... create a hashmap for these words
key would be the word itself and value would be the count. 
Every time the prog reads a word it updates the hashmap and increments the count by 1. If the word is not present it would create new key- value pair.
Finally I have to display these keys with descendign order of their values.
I hope u understand, if I have the logic I just need to understand perl syntax to implement :)
